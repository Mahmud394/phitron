    <p>
        the heading, paragraph, and line break tags are fundamental elements used to structure web content. <br>
        The heading tags (h1 to h6) define titles and subheadings, with h1 being the most important and typically <br> 
        used for the main title of a webpage. The paragraph tag (p) is 
        used to create blocks of text, allowing <br> content to be organized into readable sections with proper spacing.
        When a new line is needed within a paragraph without starting a new one, <br> the line break tag (br) is used.
        This tag forces the text that follows to appear on the next line, <br> making it useful for addresses, poems, or
        any content that requires controlled line breaks. <br> Together, these tags help in building clean, readable, and well-structured web pages.
