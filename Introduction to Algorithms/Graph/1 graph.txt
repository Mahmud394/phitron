Graph 
1. multiple edge
2. multiple way
3. cycle
4. edge driection 
graph>>tree>Bt>Bst

Types of Graph
*Driection:
	1.Directed
	2.Undirected  
*Weight:
    1.Weighted
    2.Unweighted
*Cycle:
    1.Cycle (Undirected  hole at lest 3 ta node lagbe  & Directed e 2 ta hole e hobe)
    2.Acyclic  

Real life example of graph:
1. Google map shortcut way
2. Facebook mutual friend

Input store graph:
1. Adjacency Matrix   
2. Adjacency list
3. Edge list

// chack 2 node connected or not:
    1. Adjacency Matrix -> O(1) -> use this  
    2. Adjacency list -> O(N)
    3. Edge list  ->O(N) 
// all the connected node from a node:
    Adjacency lis ->use this

// need all edge
    Edge list ->use this

Traversal:
1. BFS ->level wise short path 
2. DFS  -> Depth-wish use any path

2D Grid:
A 2D grid is a two-dimensional array of points or nodes that can be used 
for a variety of purposes, including computer graphics, scientific calculations, and 
representing sample spaces.

up->i-1,j-> -1,0
down->i+1,j -> 1,0
left->i,j-1 -> 0,-1
right->i,j+1 -> 0,1


Cycle Detection
-Undirected: atlest 3 node 
	-BFS
	-DFS
-Directed: 2 node
	-DFS
